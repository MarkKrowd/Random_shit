<h1>Sonic Verb for Buzz</h1>

<h2>Introduction...</h2>
<p>Sonic Verb is a freeware reverb for Buzz.
<p>After hearing numerous complains about Buzz not having a good-enough reverb, Carsten Sørensen and I sat down to port the Sonic Timeworks 4080L to Buzz. So now you have a $399 reverb for Buzz for free :)
<p>If you make any cool stuff with it, we would of course not mind a copy :-)
<p>I'm not sure what version of Buzz you'll need, but I was working on a beta dated 31th of July, 2000, and I'm pretty sure you'll need that as a minimum. This has to do with the reverb being stereo in / stereo out...

<h2>Legal Stuff...</h2>
<p>Sonic Verb is freeware... It is legal to copy it (but only if including this legal notice), use it and have fun with it. It is illegal to dissasemble it, reverse engineer it, and to sell it, either in its original form or in any modified form.
Oh yes, it is also illegal to distribute or re-distribute any modified version of the binary. I think I'm covered now... ;)
