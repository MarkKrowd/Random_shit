------------------------------------------------------------------------------------.-

internal signal path:

in -> pregain -> prelimiter -> drive -> tone -> postgain -> postlimiter -> out

gains:
- adjust the range from the attributes
limiters:
- hard limiter, no release control, very digital, similar to distortion of buzz output
- you can disable/enable limiters in the attributes, both default to off
drive:
- two different algorithms, select from attributes
  "monday": a faulty version of the distortion code, which sounds very good [default]
  "proper": the fixed distortion code, which well, distorts a lot
- "min drive" attribute controls the level of minimun drive
tone: 
- lopass filter after the drive
- range adjustable from attributes, separate max freqs for each drive algorithm
- don't set the max freqs over the sampling rate used in buzz (usually 44100)
inertia controls:
- for all parameters, adjust from attributes

tip:

if you want a higher freq response from the distortion just increase the max freq!
