----------------------------------
  Parameters:
----------------------------------

* I/O Mode		(0 - 8)
   - Sets the input/output mode:

	0: L/R			- Normal Left/Right input
	1: L/-R 		- Right channel is phase inverted (180 degrees) on input
	2: -L/R			- Left channel is phase inverted on input
	3: -L/-R		- Both channels are phase inverted on input
	4: Mono -> LR		- The signal is converted to mono on input, normal output
	5: Mono -> MS		- The signal is converted to mono on input, the output is 
				  in Mid/Side audio format (Center channel is output on the 
				  left audio channel, and the Stereo channel is output on the
				  right audio channel)
	6: LR -> MS		- The signal is input as normal Left/Right channel audio, but
				  is output in Mid/Side audio format.
	7: MS -> LR		- The signal is input as Mid/Side audio, with the center audio
				  part on the left channel and the Stereo audio part on the 
				  right channel, and is output as normal Left/Right stereo
				  audio.
	8: MS -> MS		- The signal is input and output in Mid/Side audio format.


	/// see the "USING MS MODES" section below ///
     

* Gain			(0 - 200%)
   - Increases/decreases the input volume.

* Center		(0 - 400%)
   - Magnifies/shrinks the center sound image. 
     0% will make a stereo sound completely out of phase.
     Center will not affect stereo information.
     On mono sounds, this is simply a gain.

* Width			(0 - 400%)
   - Expands/shrinks the stereo field. 0% is mono. 
     Above 100% will widen the stereo field "outside" the
     speakers/headphones. This has No effect on mono sounds.

* LRBalance		(full left - center - full right)
   - A "typical" left/right balance control. 
     Shifts sound from full left channel to full right channel.
     This balance control is not linear-gain (i.e., the overall
     gain changes across the parameter range)
     
* Center Axis		(-90  -  +90)
   - Balance control for the monophonic "center" part of the sound. 
     Rotates the center axis -90 to +90 degrees, keeping the stereo
     information intact. Also known as center asymmetry.
     Acts as a linear-gain typical balance control on mono sounds. (i.e.,
     the overall gain does not change across the parameter range)

* Stereo Axis		(-90  -  +90)
   - Balance control for the stereo part of the sound. 
     Rotates the stereo axis -90 to +90 degrees, keeping the center
     information intact. Also known as asymmetry or stereo asymmetry.
     No effect on mono sounds
     (* the stereo axis control is inverted)

* Rotation		(-180  -  +180)
   - Rotates both the center axis and stereo axis together, from
     -45 to +45 degrees.
     Acts as a linear-gain typical balance control on mono sounds.

* PSI Mode		(0 - 3)
   - Sets the Pseudo Stereo Imaging Mode: 

	0: OFF/RESET  -  Turns PSI off and clears internal buffers
	1: NORMAL  -  PSI is mixed with the incoming signal
	2: THRU  -  PSI is not mixed with the incoming signal
	3: ASYNC  -  PSI from the original signal is mixed with 
	             the incoming signal 

* PSI Spread		(~0ms - 50ms)
   - Sets the delay "spread" of the PSI. Values over 20ms can be heard
     as an echo.

* PSI Center Amount	(-100% - +100%)
   - This is how much of the delayed center image used for PSI.
     Negative values will reverse the polarity.

* PSI Stereo Amount	(-100% - +100%)
   - This is how much of the delayed stereo image is used for PSI.
     Negative values will reverse the polarity.

* PSI Mix Amount	(-100% - +100%)
   - This is how much of the delayed center and stereo image is crossfed for
     PSI. The delayed center will become the delayed stereo image, and the delayed
     stereo will become the delayed center (depending on the parameter below). 
     Negative values will reverse the polarity. The Mix Amount is separate from 
     and in addition to the previous two parameters.

* PSI Mix Balance	(Full Stereo - Full Center)
   - Sets the Balance between stereo and center image crossfeed for the PSI Mix Amount.
     Full Stereo means only the stereo image is delayed and fed as the center image.
     Full Center means only the center image is delayed and fed as the stereo image.

* PSI Mix Feedback	(-100%  -  +100%)
   - Sets how much of the PSI signal is fed back into itself. 0% is none. 
     Negative amounts will invert the phase of the PSI before feeding it into 
     itself. An amount of or near 100% can cause signal instability where the sound
     may grow louder and louder.


	/// see the "PSI, WINDOWING, and ROUTING" section below ///


* Window Mode		(0 - 3)
   - Sets the Frequency Window Mode:

	0: OFF/RESET  -  Turns off the Frequency Window
	1: NORMAL  -  All subsequent routed parameters will only affect
                      frequencies defined for the window
	2: THRU  -  Only pass frequencies defined for the window
	3: ASYNC  -  The frequencies defined in the window will pass the original
	             signal which the subsequent routed parameters will affect

* Window HiPass		(20hz - 20000hz)
* Window LoPass		(20hz - 20000hz)
   - Sets the frequency boundaries of the Window. If the HiPass frequency is lower than
     the LoPass frequency, then the frequency window is between the HiPass and LoPass
     frequencies. Otherwise, the window is inverted.

* Window Band Rez (Resonance)	(-256  -  +256)
   - Sets the resonance of the Frequency Window filters. This amplifies
     (for positive values) or dampens (for negative values) the frequencies
     around the Frequency Window HiPass and LoPass settings.


	/// see the "PSI, WINDOWING, and ROUTING" section below ///


* LFO 1 AND 2 CONTROLS:

 * LFO Target		(0 - 15)
    - Sets the target parameter of the LFO (Low Frequency Oscillator).
      The parameter selected will be modulated around its set value by 
      a percentage of its total range. A setting of zero turns the LFO
      off. Setting a target resets/retriggers the LFO

 * LFO Type		(0 - 5)
    - Sets the shape of the LFO curve. This also resets/retriggers the LFO.
      You may choose from:

	0: Sine wave
	1: Square wave
	2: Triange wave
	3: Saw wave (up)
 	4: Saw wave (down)
 	5: Noize/Random (Note: This is a randomized but periodic LFO. 
	                       Step capability may be added in a future release.) 

 * LFO Depth		(-100% - +100%)
    - Changes the depth of the LFO to a percentage of the target parameter's
      total range. With negative values, the LFO oscillates in the opposite
      direction.

 * LFO Rate		(0.25 ticks - 512 ticks)
    - Sets the period length of the LFO. This is how long it takes for the LFO
      to complete one cycle (i.e., in "saw up" at a rate of 64 ticks, the LFO
      will sweep the parameter from a low value to a high value over 64 ticks, 
      and then start back at the low value).

 * LFO Offset		(0% - 100%)
    - Sets the phase offset of LFO 2 from LFO 1. Acts as an LFO trigger for LFO 2,
      setting the current LFO 2 position equal to the position of LFO 1, plus the
      phase offset. If the two LFOs are set to different rates, then setting 
      offset will set the phase separation at that time, and then the LFOs will
      oscillate from there. 
      The offset % can be though of as the percentage of one complete LFO cycle.

* ROUTING TABLE:
   - This enables & orders each parameter in the specified sequence. 


	/// see the "PSI, WINDOWING, and ROUTING" section below ///

----------------------------------
  Attributes:
----------------------------------

* Sub-Tick resolution - Determines how often (in samples) the anticlick
                        routine is triggered. Lower values = finer 
			resolution = much more CPU.
                        Default is every 64 samples.
* Anticlick strength - Value to reduce clicking on parameter changes. 
                       Parameters will slide quickly from the old value
                       to the new value on every subtick (define above).
                       The strength value defines a maximum percentage of
                       change the value can make on each subtick until it
                       reaches the target value. Higher values = better
                       anticlick = longer sliding = more cpu.
                       Default is 80.  

* PSI Spread Smooth - Toggles limiting of PSI Spread parameter changes to
                      prevent clicking. This parameter may be removed 
                      in later versions.

* DC Correction - Cancels out internal DC offset on the output (centers the
                  output around zero).

 The following diagram resembles an audio vector/phase scope.
 The top half of the graph resembles the control display of 
 the Waves StereoImager DX plugin. The full graph is a 360
 degree circle that represents channel and phase information
 in an audio signal.

 To understand the diagram, think about a stereo signal over time.
 A normal signal would exist on most points on the graph. A perfect
 stereo white noise signal would look like a square diamond shape going 
 from C to -S (on the right) -C (bottom) to S back to C. Decreasing the
 volume of the stereo whitenoise signal would make the diamond smaller
 (Amplitude exists as distance from the center). A monophonic sinewave
 would exist only on the C axis, oscillating from C to -C (the bottom 
 of the graph). A sinewave on the Left speaker would oscillate only 
 on the L axis, from L to -L. (-L is the opposite part of the L axis,
 if you follow the L axis through the center to the opposite edge of
 the circle.
 
 To understand the Axes (plural of axis not axe) and Rotation, think of
 the sound being shifted to follow the axis. Specifically, the axis
 component of the sound is shifted to follow the axis modification.
 So, rotating the Center Axis 45 degrees to the right would merge it
 with the Right Channel axis, making all of the center part of the
 sound shift to the right speaker. However, the original stereo part
 of the sound stays the same. Conversely, rotating the stereo axis 45
 degrees merges it with the left channel (remember, the SAxis control
 is inverted, so 45 degrees is actually -45 degrees).
 
 Imagine the stereo whitenoise again as a diamond shaped-plot on the
 graph, but this time imagine only the outside edge, being a bounding
 box for the sound. If you connect the endpoints of the C and S axes,
 you will have this bounding box. If you rotate the Center or Stereo Axes,
 the points of the bounding box that lie on the C orS Axis will rotate
 around the circle. The bounding box shape will change accordingly (See 
 the figures below). Note that the rotated axes are not the "new"
 axes. The original axes still show the sound properties, but now of
 the "new" sound. The best way to learn is to experiment. Using a
 vector/phase scope helps too if you want to visualize things.
 Fortunately, the Zephod Scope effect can be used as such (rotate the
 display 45 degrees to the right, and swap the Left and Right channels).

##==-- PSI, WINDOWING, and ROUTING --==###
##########################################
 
 * PSI
                                
 PSI stands for "Pseudo Stereo Imaging", and is a term that, well, I 
 more or less made up. The way PSI works is by delaying the 
 sound by a fraction of a second and adding the delayed sound back
 onto the sound that was input into the PSI 'unit'. The effect is about
 like a flanger, minus the LFO.
 
 The PSI Center and PSI Stereo controls are for doing pseudo-stereo to 
 an already stereo signal. PSI Mix is for adding pseudostereo to both
 already stereo signals and also mono signals. In fact, adding PSI Mix to
 a mono signal can bring it to a full stereo life, depending on your
 settings. 

 PSI Normal mode will add the delayed signal back onto the input signal.
 PSI Thru only uses the delayed signal.
 PSI Async will cause PSI to act upon the signal that was originally
 input into the machine, unprocessed by all of the parameters that
 come before PSI in the routing section. More about this in the routing
 section below...

 * WINDOWING  (Frequency Window)
                                 
 Windowing allows parameters to work on a certain frequency range in 
 the incoming signal. Whatever parameters follow the window parameter
 Will only work within the specified frequency range.

 * ROUTING

 The parameters of SBox Pro do not necessarily operate in the order listed
 in the machine parameter view. You can put them in any order you want!
 Also, if you do not need a parameter, you can turn it off. This is
 accomplished in the Routing table. The routing table is the parameter
 section at the bottom, labelled with a "#--". The parameter value
 signifies its position in the parameter order. If two or more parameters 
 have the same position, the topmost parameter will be processed first.

 * HOW DOES THIS ALL WORK???

 Now I will explain how this all fits together, by examples. Imagine the
 route settings are set as follows:

   #--Window		=	2
   #--Center		=	
   #--Width		=	1
   #--Balance   	=
   #--CAxis		=	
   #--SAxis		=	
   #--Rotation		=	3
   #--PSI		=	4

 Window, Center, Rotation, and PSI sections are turned on. All other
 sections are turned off (parameter value full left). The order of
 parameter processing is

   #1 - Width
   #2 - Window
   #3 - Rotation
   #4 - PSI

 Now, say we set Window HiPass to 5000hz and Window LoPass to 10000hz.
 We'll set Window Mode to Normal, and PSI Mode to Normal. Now, we 
 will set Width to 200%, and Rotation to 30°. 
 The effect routing will happen like this (not necessarily to scale):

 20hz                                         20000hz
 ----------------------------------------------------------------
 |                original sound                                | <--- input

 |             |                |                               |
 ----------------------------------------------------------------

 ----------------------------------------------------------------
             5000hz          10000hz
             HiPass          LoPass
 

 Here, the frequency window split up the sound *after*
 the sound is widened by 200%. The 200% widened sound is then
 rotated 30°, but only between 5000hz and 10000hz. That same area
 is then processed by pseudostereo imaging (PSI), where the widened,
 rotated sound is delayed and then added back onto itself.

 Now, lets set Window Mode to Async:

 20hz                                         20000hz
 ----------------------------------------------------------------
 |               original sound                                 | <--- input 
 |                                                              |
 ----------------------------------------------------------------
 |                 width 200%                                   | <--- width
 |                                                              |
 ----------------------------------------------------------------
 | width 200%  | original sound |          width 200%           | <--- Window (Async)
 |             |                |                               |
 ----------------------------------------------------------------
 | width200%   |   rotate 30°   |          width 200%           | <--- Rotate
 |             |                |                               |
 |             |                |                               |
 ----------------------------------------------------------------
 | width200%   |   rotate 30°   |          width 200%           | <--- PSI
 |             |-> PSI          |                               |
 |             |                |                               |
 ----------------------------------------------------------------
             5000hz          10000hz
             HiPass          LoPass

 In this example, the frequency window split up the sound after
 the sound is widened by 200%, but the area inside the window is
 now the original sound (between 5000hz and 10000hz). This origial 
 sound is then rotated 30° and processed by pseudostereo imaging, 
 where the rotated sound is delayed and then added back onto itself.

 Getting interesting yet?  We can also do PSI Async: 


 20hz                                         20000hz
 ----------------------------------------------------------------
 |               original sound                                 | <--- input 
 |                                                              |
 ----------------------------------------------------------------

 |                                                              |
 ----------------------------------------------------------------
 | width 200%  | original sound |          width 200%           | <--- Window (Async)

 |             |                |                               |

             5000hz          10000hz
             HiPass          LoPass

 Now, the frequency window split up the sound after
 the sound is widened by 200%, with the area inside the window now
 the original sound (between 5000hz and 10000hz). The windowed origial 
 sound is then rotated 30°. Now, the *unwindowed* original sound is 
 processed by pseudostereo imaging, being delayed and then added back into
 the mix thus far. Async modes always bypass all previous effects,
 including PSI and Window themselves, and acts upon the original sound.
 Remember this, because it can get tricky!

 But, what about Thru modes? Thru modes are useful for separating the
 effect output from the direct output. In buzz terminology, this is
 sometimes called "sidechaining" (which technically it is not, but we
 will call it that for naming sake). You do this by sending a signal
 through an effect and then to an output (master or another effect),
 and also sending the signal itself to the output, thereby making the 
 effect a "sidechain":

           /--effect------|

 When the effect is a sidechain, you dont want to pass too much of the
 original sound through it. Since PSI also adds the inputted sound,
 sometimes this can be a problem. This is where Thru comes in:

 Note that when windowed, only the frequencies within the window
 are passed along. Also, only the delayed part of the PSI section
 is passed. The widened, rotated sound is delayed, but not added
 back onto itself. Of course, you could have Window Normal/Async,
 and PSI Thru to have just the windowed part delayed for a weird
 effect.

 One last thing. What happens when the HiPass frequency is higher
 than the LoPass frequency? Well lets see. Here we will make the
 Window mode Normal, remove PSI, make HiPass = 12000hz, and LoPass
 = 6000hz:

########==-- USING I/O MODES--==##########
##########################################

 The I/O Mode parameter is useful for correcting sounds that are 
 completely out of phase. By setting the parameter to L/-R, or
 -L/R, you can correct stereo phase problems. Also, you can correct
 effect chain phase problems by setting the parameter to -L/-R.
 See the "Special Considerations" section for more infomation about 
 phase problems.

 The I/O Mode parameter also allows you to use other effects to
 modify sounds by their center and stereo channels instead of just
 by modifying the left and right channels directly. Setting I/O mode
 to LR->MS will allow the next effect in the chain to operate on
 a signal this way. The left audio channel outputted will be the 
 "Center" channel, and the right audio channel will be the "Stereo" 
 channel. After the effect, another StereoBox Pro with an I/O Mode of
 MS->LR will convert the sound back to normal Left/Right audio.
 With some effects, you may not hear much of a difference. But sounds
 that give more stereo control, or by sending the left & right channel
 (in LR->MS mode) independendly to separate effects, you can do some
 pretty interesting things to the stereo signal. 

 For example, if you have a monophonic generator routed through a 
 jeskola x-delay, and then routed to a SBox Pro setup for LR->MS,
 the signal output will have both the default sound and the echoes
 on the left channel, but the right channel will only have the
 echoes. Also, you could do other pseudostereo effects on a signal
 by sending the mono signal through a pan machine panned hard left
 into an SBox Pro set to MS->LR, and then adding an effect such as
 a bandpass filter or a chorus set to thru mode to the mono signal
 through a pan machine panned hard right into the SBox Pro.

####==-- SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS --==######
##########################################

* OUT OF PHASE SOUND
  - Sounds that exist on the S axis but not (or barely) on the
    C axis are out of phase. This means that 1) when converting the
    sound to mono, you will diminish or convert parts of the sound to 
    silence (especially bad for bass), 2) when listening to the sound in
    stereo, it may cause extra fatigue and uncomfortability (it is
    stressful for your ears and brain), 3) when listening to the sound
    in stereo, bass sections will be produced by the speakers but will be
    muted in airspace, since the left and right speakers will cancel each
    other out in the middle. 

    StereoBox Pro can make sounds out of phase easily, so be careful
    (see differences from StereoBox below).
    Be careful when setting rotation, CAxis, or SAxis beyond 45°, 
    and reducing the Center parameter amount to below 50%. Also, check to
    make sure the I/O Mode parameter is not set to make a normal sound
    out-of-phase.

* LOWERING CPU USAGE
  - If you find this effect hogging up precious cpu cycles, then read 
    through this. Here are some things that can give you your cpu back:
    1) If you are not using a parameter, turn it off in the routing 
       section. Even PSI and Window Modes of OFF/RESET take a little cpu.
    2) PSI and Windowing are the heaviest effects. If you can get by
       without them, you'll save much cpu.
    3) In the attributes, keep the resolution at higher values.
    4) Having the LFO targets set to PSI Spread, HiPass, LoPass, or
       especially Resonance, chews up more cpu than the other targets.
    5) Using LFOs take up more cpu than not using LFOs, of course. However,
       even using LFOs on targets that are turned off in the routing table
       will consume cpu.
    6) If you can live with a tiny amount of DC Offset, turn DC Correction
       off in the attributes. This only saves a tiny fraction of CPU, so
       it is normal to leave this on.
 
* CLICKS
  - StereoBox Pro was designed to minimize clicks as much as possible.
    Causing large jumps in parameter settings by parameter entry or by
    using Square, SawUp, SawDn, and Noize LFO type, can sometimes cause
    minor clicks. Here are some suggestions for reducing these clicks:

    1) Modify subtick and/or anticlick attributes 
       (this does not affect the lfo shapes).
    2) Set the Window Hipass frequency so that clicks in the bass range 
       are minimized.
    3) Dont LFO or make sudden changes to the PSI Spread parameter. 
       When oscillating the PSI Spread with an LFO, the PSI acts somewhat
       as a flanger. However, the wrong LFO waveform or large PSI Spread 
       parameter changes may cause PSI to click. With a fast LFO rate, you 
       might hear a "zipper" noise. To fix this, make smaller changes, choose
       a triangle or sine LFO shape, and slow down the LFO.

###==-- DIFFERENCES FROM StereoBox --==###
##########################################
       
 Besides the number of parameters, StereoBox Pro has some other key
 differences from StereoBox. StereoBox's parameter ranges for 
 rotation, Center Axis, and Stereo Axis are designed to do natural
 corrections to audio, and not to bring the sound to an out-of-phase
 state (described above). StereoBox Pro does not have these limitations.
 StereoBox Pro can do everything StereoBox can, but is designed for
 much more advanced uses.

StereBox Pro is donationware. This means you are free to use it. Just
you will have to send me your firstborn. I'm just kidding.
You may use it as free of charge. Drop me an email saying "thanks"
or "cool" if you like it. Alternately, you could send me three 
billion dollars. You cannot, however, sell this or repackage this
in any form without my permission.

Use at your own risk. I am not a perfect coder. At best, it will 
run fine. At worst, it could cause nuclear devastation, with your
machine being ground zero. However, that is unlikely. But in case
it causes any damage from a) making your song turn out bad to z)
causing a large population of people to disappear, I cannot be held
responsible.
