DrumKits here are just normal FLP files. The only advantage of putting
them here is that they will be listed in the DrumKits menu in FruityLoops.
It's just for beginners or those who want to use the same samples over & over.

DrumKits are put in the \Samples\DrumKits subdir (& not in the \loops subdir) 
so that the samples can be found more easily.
