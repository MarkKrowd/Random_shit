A Note from Samplephonics....

Congratulations on your purchase! We hope you have as much fun using it 
as we had making it. 

We'd like to request that you don't illegally share any of the material 
in here. Not only does this harm Samplephonics and restrict our 
development, it also harms the musicians and sound designers we work 
with. As you are no doubt aware, the music industry can be tough at the 
best of times, and by illegally sharing material purchased from 
Samplephonics the livelihood and income of our musicians and sound 
designers is directly affected. We all put a lot of work into every 
single product we release and it is a shame when some people are not able 
to appreciate the effects of illegal file sharing. Sharing files and 
downloading illegally shared files is considered as theft and 
Samplephonics work hard to track down and prosecute anyone who breaches 
the terms and conditions they agree to when purchasing this product. 
Please respect the artists and only use these samples for your own 
productions. 

From everyone at Samplephonics, thanks for purchasing this product! 
Please get in touch if you have any feedback, we're always open to new 
suggestions.
