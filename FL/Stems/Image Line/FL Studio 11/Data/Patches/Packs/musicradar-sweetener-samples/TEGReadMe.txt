This month we offer up a selection of "ear candy".  These sounds are perfect for spicing up your tracks with a bit of drama and atmosphere.  If you are getting weary of the same old reversed cymbals and snare fills, look no further!  We put our finest kit to use to provide you with tension-filled rumbles, exciting sweeps and even some tasty acoustic tidbits.  As usual, our massive modular system was called into action, along with Symbolic Sound's Kyma.  Acoustic tones were tracked with our trusty Neumann TLM-103 through the Chandler Limited EMI/Abbey Road mic pres.  Most of the pitched sounds were sampled at c3, though a few were sampled at various pitches in order to provide versatility.  When this is the case, the pitch is indicated in the file names.  Some sounds have a bit of rhytmic content...these are often at 120 BPM.

So, if you have been looking for that perfect timbral touch to push your tune oiver the top,  load 'em up!
